The purpose of this study was to explore how DAP structure and function enable ICC and whether that may be associated with anizational and clinical outcomes. Methods A case study approach will be used to explore ICC among eight DAPs that vary by type of cancer (lung breast) academic status and geographic region. To describe DAP function and outcomes and gather information that will enable costing recommendations expressed in DAP standards and clinical guidelines will be assessed through retrospective observational study. Data will be acquired from databases maintained by participating DAPs and the provincial cancer agency and confirmed by and supplemented with review of medical records. We will conduct a pilot study to explore the feasibility of estimating the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio using person-level data from medical records and other sources. Interviews will be conducted with health professionals staff and referring physicians from each DAP to learn about barriers and facilitators of ICC. Qualitative methods based on a grounded approach will be used to guide sampling data collection and analysis. Discussion Findings may reveal opportunities for unique structures interventions or tools that enable ICC that could be developed implemented and evaluated through future research. This information will serve as a formative needs assessment to identify the nature of ongoing or required improvements which can be directly used by our decision maker collaborators and as a framework by policy makers cancer system managers and DAP managers elsewhere to strategically plan for and implement diagnostic cancer services. Inter-professional collaborative care Multidisciplinary care team Inter-professional relations Communication Cooperative behavior Diagnostic assessment program Breast cancer Lung cancer Background Need for collaborative cancer care Most cancer patients require multimodal assessment and treatment including radiologic and pathologic detection confirmation and characterization and surgery chemotherapy and/or radiation for cure or palliation [1]. Following initial treatment patient needs vary as they undergo follow-up surveillance to detect recurrent or secondary cancer with many facing physiological and psychosocial difficulties as a result of their cancer and/or its treatment [2]. In addition most cancer patients require management to prevent or treat co-morbid conditions [3]. Thus cancer management is complex and compounded by the fact that multimodal care is delivered by different professionals in different settings and at different time points. Research has established that coordinated collaborative service delivery improves clinical (i.e. mortality length of stay readmission) and patient-reported (i.e. satisfaction health related quality of life) outcomes for a variety of acute and chronic conditions including cancer [145]. This concept of inter-professional collaborative care (ICC) requires ongoing interaction among various types of health professionals to assess plan negotiate provide and review care for individual patients [6]. Barriers of collaborative cancer care It has been proposed that one-third of cancer cases could be prevented another third cured and the rest effectively treated if management consistently complied with existing guidelines [7]. Most cancer management guidelines recommend ICC but do not specify how this can be achieved [8]. A non-systematic review of the literature on ICC in cancer found that formal policies and structures improved treatment decisions implementation of treatment decisions documentation of treatment decisions attendance at joint meetings professional diversity at meetings completeness of information presented at meetings management according to guideline recommendations time to diagnosis or treatment survival role identification among team members team effectiveness and staff wellbeing [9]. However timely and appropriate ICC was challenged by many patient provider team and system level factors [10]. Other barriers included strategic differences across anizations limited administrative support and identified leads for the collaborative process and anizational and individual provider reluctance to share resources and power [11]. Given multiple associated benefits efforts are needed to promote and support ICC for the clinical management of cancer patients. First improved understanding of which ICC approaches lead to improved patient provider and anizational or system outcomes is required so that we can meaningfully evaluate whether and how cancer patients experience ICC [1213]. Further understanding of how various ICC models lead to beneficial patient provider institutional and health system outcomes will provide insight on when and in what way to implement these models. Our research on collaborative cancer care We have jointly conducted several research studies that identified numerous challenges of ICC for cancer and evaluated the availability and impact of interventions to support ICC. ARG surveyed and interviewed Ontario clinicians and managers involved in cancer care across several studies. Participants identified numerous ICC challenges such as timely access to testing for diagnosis and staging lack of human and technical resources identifying and communicating with specialists coordinating referral to and back from specialists confusion among multidisciplinary team members about who was to coordinate management and the need for system level support [14-19]. Interventions to support ICC suggested by participants included patient held medical records cancer specific medical record standardized referral and reply forms centralized cancer diagnostic facilities regional outreach clinics and use of telemedicine. ARG conceptually analyzed the literature to describe models of ICC [20]. Determinants of positive objective and subjective patient team and anizational outcomes included system or anizational support team structure and team processes. ARG reviewed empirical research evaluating ICC for cancer patients [20]. Twenty-two studies of mixed design published between 2001 and 2009 were eligible. The majority of studies (17/22) assessed the role of general practitioners and supportive/palliative care workers in cancer patient follow-up. Five of 22 studies evaluated ICC for diagnosis or treatment decision making. Apart from tumor boards no studies described interventions to enable ICC. Collectively this research suggests that most cancer providers function through parallel or consultative rather than integrated models of care. FCW spearheaded several investigations to describe and evaluate multidisciplinary cancer conferences (MCCs) as an intervention to support ICC. Also known as tumor boards these are defined as regularly scheduled meetings where healthcare providers discuss the treatment of individual cancer patients [1]. First she chaired a multidisciplinary panel to issue an evidence- and consensus-based guideline describing MCCs [1]. FCW conducted a systematic review of the literature to examine the impact of ICC on clinical outcomes [21].\\\"\",\n          \"RANK are expressed in different cell types and tissues throughout

ERR\\u00ce\\u00b1RANKexpression as well as a positive correlation between ERR\\u00ce\\u00b1and BRCA1 mutation carriers revealing a novel pathwaywhereby ERR\\u00ce\\u00b1 in primary breast cancer could promote earlydissemination of cancer cells to bone  Moreover it wasrecently shown that RANKL serum levels are signi\\u00ef\\u00ac\\u0081cantlyincreased in breast cancer patients who developed bonemetastases p   and patients within the highest quartileof RANKL had a signi\\u00ef\\u00ac\\u0081cantly increased risk of developing bonemetastases compared to those in the lowest HR  95CI\\u0093 p    This study further suggests a role ofRANKL in breast cancer metastasis TARGETING RANKLRANK IN HUMANCANCERIn light of the di\\u00ef\\u00acerent roles of the RANKLRANK pathwayin bone metabolism and immune system functions therapytargeting this axis may not only control primary tumordevelopment such as in the case of breast cancer and reducebone metastasis which has been demonstrated in clinical trials  but also exert a direct antitumor e\\u00ef\\u00acect via regulatinglocal tumorassociated immune responses as observed in studiesusing the monoclonal RANKL antibody inhibitor Denosumab In randomized clinical trials Denosumab has shown rapide\\u00ef\\u00acectiveness by directly impairing osteoclast activity andinducing osteoclast apoptosis  Moreover Denosumabwassigni\\u00ef\\u00ac\\u0081cantly more e\\u00ef\\u00acective in reducing urinary Nterminal peptides a biochemical marker for bone turnoverFrontiers in Oncology  wwwfrontiersinAugust

NSCLC and multiple myeloma MMpatients with bone metastases is comparable to bisphosphonatedrugs \\u0093 Moreover the bene\\u00ef\\u00ac\\u0081t of Denosumab andbisphosphonates is not only restricted to osteolytic cancers suchas breast myeloma and NSCLC but also evident in osteoblasticcancers Recently it was demonstrated in osteoblastic cancerssuch as prostate cancer that Denosumab or bisphosphonate cana\\u00ef\\u00acect the osteoclastosteoblast balance in the \\u009cvicious cycle\\u009d ofbone destruction induced by metastasized cancer cells which highlights the potential rationale in treating osteoblasticcancer patients with Denosumab or bisphosphonatesIn a randomized phase III clinical trial comparing Denosumaband bisphosphonate zoledronic acid ZA in patients with solidtumors breast cancer prostate cancer multiple myeloma andbone metastases the results showed that Denosumab was similarto ZA in preventing or delaying the onset of primary SREs   However in nonsmallcell lung carcinoma NSCLCn   treatment with Denosumab showed a signi\\u00ef\\u00ac\\u0081cantimprovement in overall survival  In these patients nostatistically signi\\u00ef\\u00ac\\u0081cant SRE delay was observed in Denosumabtreated patients suggesting that this survival advantage maybe independent of the bone system  The result of arandomized phase III trial of multiple myeloma MM patientsn   also demonstrated the e\\u00ef\\u00acectivity of Denosumab toreduce the occurrence of primary SRE events moreover the useof Denosumab signi\\u00ef\\u00ac\\u0081cantly improved progressionfree survivalPFS  Whether this survival bene\\u00ef\\u00ac\\u0081t is due to the decreasein the incidence of bone metastasis or whether Denosumab hasother antitumor e\\u00ef\\u00acects requires further researchIn the randomized placebocontrolled phase III ABCSG18trial which enrolled  postmenopausal female patients withearly hormone receptorpositive breast cancer the \\u00ef\\u00ac\\u0081rst clinicalfracture of the Denosumabtreated group was compared with theplacebo group and a signi\\u00ef\\u00ac\\u0081cant protection of bone breaks wasdemonstrated hazard ratio

\\u0093Cox p   These data suggest that adjuvant Denosumabcan signi\\u00ef\\u00ac\\u0081cantly improve the DFS rate of HR postmenopausalbreast cancer patients  However in another randomizedphase III clinical trial of breast cancer DCARE recent reportshave shown that adjuvant Denosumab does not reduce therisk of breast cancer recurrence or death in earlystage breastcancer patients receiving standard adjuvant therapy  Theseinconsistencies which could be explained by di\\u00ef\\u00acerent cohortsfor patient strati\\u00ef\\u00ac\\u0081cations eg more advanced early cases ofbreast cancer

ABCSG18 trial con\\u00ef\\u00ac\\u0081rmed thethat blocking RANKL in an adjuvant breast cancer therapysetting not only markedly reduces the risk of breaking bones butalso signi\\u00ef\\u00ac\\u0081cantly reduces the reoccurrence of the breast tumors  It should be also noted that although there was nodi\\u00ef\\u00acerence in bonemetastasesfreesurvival in the DCARE

The purpose of this study was to explore how DAP structure and function enable ICC and whether that may be associated with anizational and clinical outcomes. Methods A case study approach will be used to explore ICC among eight DAPs that vary by type of cancer (lung breast) academic status and geographic region. To describe DAP function and outcomes and gather information that will enable costing recommendations expressed in DAP standards and clinical guidelines will be assessed through retrospective observational study. Data will be acquired from databases maintained by participating DAPs and the provincial cancer agency and confirmed by and supplemented with review of medical records. We will conduct a pilot study to explore the feasibility of estimating the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio using person-level data from medical records and other sources. Interviews will be conducted with health professionals staff and referring physicians from each DAP to learn about barriers and facilitators of ICC. Qualitative methods based on a grounded approach will be used to guide sampling data collection and analysis. Discussion Findings may reveal opportunities for unique structures interventions or tools that enable ICC that could be developed implemented and evaluated through future research. This information will serve as a formative needs assessment to identify the nature of ongoing or required improvements which can be directly used by our decision maker collaborators and as a framework by policy makers cancer system managers and DAP managers elsewhere to strategically plan for and implement diagnostic cancer services. Inter-professional collaborative care Multidisciplinary care team Inter-professional relations Communication Cooperative behavior Diagnostic assessment program Breast cancer Lung cancer Background Need for collaborative cancer care Most cancer patients require multimodal assessment and treatment including radiologic and pathologic detection confirmation and characterization and surgery chemotherapy and/or radiation for cure or palliation [1]. Following initial treatment patient needs vary as they undergo follow-up surveillance to detect recurrent or secondary cancer with many facing physiological and psychosocial difficulties as a result of their cancer and/or its treatment [2]. In addition most cancer patients require management to prevent or treat co-morbid conditions [3]. Thus cancer management is complex and compounded by the fact that multimodal care is delivered by different professionals in different settings and at different time points. Research has established that coordinated collaborative service delivery improves clinical (i.e. mortality length of stay readmission) and patient-reported (i.e. satisfaction health related quality of life) outcomes for a variety of acute and chronic conditions including cancer [145]. This concept of inter-professional collaborative care (ICC) requires ongoing interaction among various types of health professionals to assess plan negotiate provide and review care for individual patients [6]. Barriers of collaborative cancer care It has been proposed that one-third of cancer cases could be prevented another third cured and the rest effectively treated if management consistently complied with existing guidelines [7]. Most cancer management guidelines recommend ICC but do not specify how this can be achieved [8]. A non-systematic review of the literature on ICC in cancer found that formal policies and structures improved treatment decisions implementation of treatment decisions documentation of treatment decisions attendance at joint meetings professional diversity at meetings completeness of information presented at meetings management according to guideline recommendations time to diagnosis or treatment survival role identification among team members team effectiveness and staff wellbeing [9]. However timely and appropriate ICC was challenged by many patient provider team and system level factors [10]. Other barriers included strategic differences across anizations limited administrative support and identified leads for the collaborative process and anizational and individual provider reluctance to share resources and power [11]. Given multiple associated benefits efforts are needed to promote and support ICC for the clinical management of cancer patients. First improved understanding of which ICC approaches lead to improved patient provider and anizational or system outcomes is required so that we can meaningfully evaluate whether and how cancer patients experience ICC [1213]. Further understanding of how various ICC models lead to beneficial patient provider institutional and health system outcomes will provide insight on when and in what way to implement these models. Our research on collaborative cancer care We have jointly conducted several research studies that identified numerous challenges of ICC for cancer and evaluated the availability and impact of interventions to support ICC. ARG surveyed and interviewed Ontario clinicians and managers involved in cancer care across several studies. Participants identified numerous ICC challenges such as timely access to testing for diagnosis and staging lack of human and technical resources identifying and communicating with specialists coordinating referral to and back from specialists confusion among multidisciplinary team members about who was to coordinate management and the need for system level support [14-19]. Interventions to support ICC suggested by participants included patient held medical records cancer specific medical record standardized referral and reply forms centralized cancer diagnostic facilities regional outreach clinics and use of telemedicine. ARG conceptually analyzed the literature to describe models of ICC [20]. Determinants of positive objective and subjective patient team and anizational outcomes included system or anizational support team structure and team processes. ARG reviewed empirical research evaluating ICC for cancer patients [20]. Twenty-two studies of mixed design published between 2001 and 2009 were eligible. The majority of studies (17/22) assessed the role of general practitioners and supportive/palliative care workers in cancer patient follow-up. Five of 22 studies evaluated ICC for diagnosis or treatment decision making. Apart from tumor boards no studies described interventions to enable ICC. Collectively this research suggests that most cancer providers function through parallel or consultative rather than integrated models of care. FCW spearheaded several investigations to describe and evaluate multidisciplinary cancer conferences (MCCs) as an intervention to support ICC. Also known as tumor boards these are defined as regularly scheduled meetings where healthcare providers discuss the treatment of individual cancer patients [1]. First she chaired a multidisciplinary panel to issue an evidence- and consensus-based guideline describing MCCs [1]. FCW conducted a systematic review of the literature to examine the impact of ICC on clinical outcomes [21].\\\"\",\n          \"RANK are expressed in different cell types and tissues throughout

The purpose of this study was to explore how DAP structure and function enable ICC and whether that may be associated with anizational and clinical outcomes. Methods A case study approach will be used to explore ICC among eight DAPs that vary by type of cancer (lung breast) academic status and geographic region. To describe DAP function and outcomes and gather information that will enable costing recommendations expressed in DAP standards and clinical guidelines will be assessed through retrospective observational study. Data will be acquired from databases maintained by participating DAPs and the provincial cancer agency and confirmed by and supplemented with review of medical records. We will conduct a pilot study to explore the feasibility of estimating the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio using person-level data from medical records and other sources. Interviews will be conducted with health professionals staff and referring physicians from each DAP to learn about barriers and facilitators of ICC. Qualitative methods based on a grounded approach will be used to guide sampling data collection and analysis. Discussion Findings may reveal opportunities for unique structures interventions or tools that enable ICC that could be developed implemented and evaluated through future research. This information will serve as a formative needs assessment to identify the nature of ongoing or required improvements which can be directly used by our decision maker collaborators and as a framework by policy makers cancer system managers and DAP managers elsewhere to strategically plan for and implement diagnostic cancer services. Inter-professional collaborative care Multidisciplinary care team Inter-professional relations Communication Cooperative behavior Diagnostic assessment program Breast cancer Lung cancer Background Need for collaborative cancer care Most cancer patients require multimodal assessment and treatment including radiologic and pathologic detection confirmation and characterization and surgery chemotherapy and/or radiation for cure or palliation [1]. Following initial treatment patient needs vary as they undergo follow-up surveillance to detect recurrent or secondary cancer with many facing physiological and psychosocial difficulties as a result of their cancer and/or its treatment [2]. In addition most cancer patients require management to prevent or treat co-morbid conditions [3]. Thus cancer management is complex and compounded by the fact that multimodal care is delivered by different professionals in different settings and at different time points. Research has established that coordinated collaborative service delivery improves clinical (i.e. mortality length of stay readmission) and patient-reported (i.e. satisfaction health related quality of life) outcomes for a variety of acute and chronic conditions including cancer [145]. This concept of inter-professional collaborative care (ICC) requires ongoing interaction among various types of health professionals to assess plan negotiate provide and review care for individual patients [6]. Barriers of collaborative cancer care It has been proposed that one-third of cancer cases could be prevented another third cured and the rest effectively treated if management consistently complied with existing guidelines [7]. Most cancer management guidelines recommend ICC but do not specify how this can be achieved [8]. A non-systematic review of the literature on ICC in cancer found that formal policies and structures improved treatment decisions implementation of treatment decisions documentation of treatment decisions attendance at joint meetings professional diversity at meetings completeness of information presented at meetings management according to guideline recommendations time to diagnosis or treatment survival role identification among team members team effectiveness and staff wellbeing [9]. However timely and appropriate ICC was challenged by many patient provider team and system level factors [10]. Other barriers included strategic differences across anizations limited administrative support and identified leads for the collaborative process and anizational and individual provider reluctance to share resources and power [11]. Given multiple associated benefits efforts are needed to promote and support ICC for the clinical management of cancer patients. First improved understanding of which ICC approaches lead to improved patient provider and anizational or system outcomes is required so that we can meaningfully evaluate whether and how cancer patients experience ICC [1213]. Further understanding of how various ICC models lead to beneficial patient provider institutional and health system outcomes will provide insight on when and in what way to implement these models. Our research on collaborative cancer care We have jointly conducted several research studies that identified numerous challenges of ICC for cancer and evaluated the availability and impact of interventions to support ICC. ARG surveyed and interviewed Ontario clinicians and managers involved in cancer care across several studies. Participants identified numerous ICC challenges such as timely access to testing for diagnosis and staging lack of human and technical resources identifying and communicating with specialists coordinating referral to and back from specialists confusion among multidisciplinary team members about who was to coordinate management and the need for system level support [14-19]. Interventions to support ICC suggested by participants included patient held medical records cancer specific medical record standardized referral and reply forms centralized cancer diagnostic facilities regional outreach clinics and use of telemedicine. ARG conceptually analyzed the literature to describe models of ICC [20]. Determinants of positive objective and subjective patient team and anizational outcomes included system or anizational support team structure and team processes. ARG reviewed empirical research evaluating ICC for cancer patients [20]. Twenty-two studies of mixed design published between 2001 and 2009 were eligible. The majority of studies (17/22) assessed the role of general practitioners and supportive/palliative care workers in cancer patient follow-up. Five of 22 studies evaluated ICC for diagnosis or treatment decision making. Apart from tumor boards no studies described interventions to enable ICC. Collectively this research suggests that most cancer providers function through parallel or consultative rather than integrated models of care. FCW spearheaded several investigations to describe and evaluate multidisciplinary cancer conferences (MCCs) as an intervention to support ICC. Also known as tumor boards these are defined as regularly scheduled meetings where healthcare providers discuss the treatment of individual cancer patients [1]. First she chaired a multidisciplinary panel to issue an evidence- and consensus-based guideline describing MCCs [1]. FCW conducted a systematic review of the literature to examine the impact of ICC on clinical outcomes [21].\\\"\",\n          \"RANK are expressed in different cell types and tissues throughout

geneticdrivers for hereditary breast cancer in humans Interestinglywomen with germline BRCA12 mutations usually exhibithigher progesterone and estrogen levels during the gestationalphase ofthe estrous

stimulating tumor neovascularizationand promoting distant metastasis of tumor cells Disseminated tumor cells are responsible for the earlymetastasis of tumors which frequently can be detected inthe bone marrow of patients with malignant tumors This\\u009cmicrometastases niche\\u009d forms a favorable microenvironmentfor the development of metastatic spread protecting cancer cellsfrom various antitumor treatments and modulating anticancerimmune responses thereby allowing the tumor cells to escapeimmune surveillance  The tumor microenvironment is acomplex milieu composed of distinct factors such as cytokinesextracellular matrix components and various cell types suchas \\u00ef\\u00ac\\u0081broblasts endothelial cells and immune cells all ofwhich participate in cancer development progression andmetastasis  In bone tissue the tumor microenvironmentincludes immune and tumor cells as well as osteoblasts andosteoclasts all of which participate in a \\u009cvicious cycle\\u009d thataccelerates osteolysis and cancer cell proliferation through inpart the RANKRANKLOPG axis   For instance cancercells can increase the expression of RANKL in osteoclastsby secreting parathyroid hormonerelated peptide PTHrP  Tumor cells can also directly express RANKLand secrete cytokines such as interleukin IL1\\u00ce\\u00b1   TNF\\u00ce\\u00b1 macrophage colonystimulating factor MCSF orprostaglandin E2 PGE2 all of which promote osteoclastdi\\u00ef\\u00acerentiation and survival resulting in local osteolysis whichsupports metastatic growth \\u0093 Subsequently growthfactors

regulate the production ofchemokines and promote the proliferation of Treg lymphocyteswhich supports the immunosuppressive milieu within the tumormicroenvironment Recently it has been reported that

to osteolytic cancers suchas breast myeloma and NSCLC but also evident in osteoblasticcancers Recently it was demonstrated in osteoblastic cancerssuch as prostate cancer that Denosumab or

stimulator of interferongenes STING are involved in mediating fundamental innate antimicrobial immunity by promoting the release oftype I interferons IFNs and other inflammatory cytokines Accumulating evidence suggests that the activation ofthe cGASSTING axis is critical for antitumor immunity The downstream cytokines regulated by cGASSTINGespecially type I IFNs serve as bridges connecting innate immunity with adaptive immunity Accordingly a growingnumber of studies have focused on the synthesis and screening of STING pathway agonists However chronicSTING activation may lead to a protumor phenotype in certain malignancies Hence the cGASSTING signalingpathway must be orchestrated properly when STING agonists are used alone or in combination In this review wediscuss the dichotomous roles

but also modulatestumorigenesis Hence in this review we summarize themechanism of cGASSTING activation and elaboratefindings regarding its dual effects on tumor developmentCurrent advances in the use of STING agonists as a novelstrategy for antitumor therapy are also reviewedInsights into the cGASSTING signal transductioncascadecGAS is an innate immune sensor that identifies variouscytosolic

interacting with dsDNA in a sequence[\\u0093]independent butStructural and biochemical analyses have revealed thatthe Cterminal lobe of cGAS contains a conserved zinclengthdependent mannerionbinding module that mediates DNA binding andcGAS dimerization [ ] DNA ligands promotecGAS activation primarily by inducing conformationalchanges around the catalytic site and in the DNAbinding structures of cGASthe GScontaining loopundergoes conformational change to maintain stabilitywhich is a major mechanism of cGAS activation byDNA [] In addition to the primary DNAbinding sitementioned above the secondary site located beside theprimary site is a helix formed between strands 78and several surfaceexposed loops [] The proximity ofthe two DNAbinding sites in cGAS leads to a  cGASDNA complex

catalyticpocket which may explain the exclusive activation ofcGAS by dsDNA Ultimately cGAMP acts as a secondmessenger to bind to and activate STING a small endoplasmic reticulum ERlocated protein   KD withfour putative transmembrane domains [ ] Normally in a resting state STING is retained in the ER byinteracting with the Ca2 sensor stromalinteractionmolecule  STIM1 [] The cytosolic

bacteria Upon interaction the obviousclosure of the ligand binding pocket in the LBD is observed which is related to the activation of STING []Next STING transforms into a tetramer through a highorder oligomerization reaction and is translocated fromthe ER to the perinuclear area facilitated by cytoplasmiccoat protein complex II COPII and ADPribosylationfactor ARF GTPases [ ] In the Golgi STING ispalmitoylated atCys88 andCys91 a posttranslational modification necessary forSTING activation [] Modified STING recruits thekinase TANKbinding kinase  TBK1 in turn the Cterminal domains of STING are phosphorylated byTBK1 and then phosphorylated STING recruits interferon regulatory factor  IRF3 which is also phosphorylated by TBK1 and dimerizes ultimately dimerizedIRF3 enters the nucleus and

transferred through gapjunctions or delivered in viralexosome packages cGASSTING signaling may be activated in the cytoplasmwithout dsDNA [ ] Moreover newly produced typeI IFNs activate heterodimer interferon receptors IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 through paracrine signaling and thusinduce the transcription of ISGs [ ] In summaryonce virusderived DNA and selfDNA are located intwo cysteine residuesthe cytoplasm they can be sensed by cGAS and a cGASdsDNA complex is formed to catalyze the synthesis of \\u00b2\\u00b2cGAMP with ATP and GTP Then \\u00b2\\u00b2cGAMP and bacteriaderived CDNs induce STING

However DNA leaks aberrantly in tumorcells [ ] Cancer cells share common features including genome instability tumor suppressor gene mutation or deletion oxidativeand vigorousmetabolism [] Under these intense states nuclear andmitochondrial DNA is fragile and easily damaged whichleads to eventual DNA leakage in the forms of micronuclei chromatin fragments andor free telomeric DNA[  ] Chromosomal instability CIN is the primary source of cytoplasmic DNA in malignant cells andis generally associated with tumor progression distantmetastasis and therapeutic tolerance [] Excessive proliferation of cancer cells results in unstable genomes [] usuallychromosomal missegregation during mitosis Due to defects in segregation lagging chromosomes generate micronuclei in a cellcycledependent manner [] The vulnerable membraneof micronuclei easily exposes the inner DNA to the cytoplasm and activates the cGASSTING signaling axis [] Exogenous stimuli such as chemotherapy and irradiation can also cause DNA damage In addition to leakednuclear DNA oxidative stressinduced mitochondrialDNA leakage is another crucial initiator of STING pathway activation Several anticancer treatments that precisely attack mitochondrial membranes result in effluxand cell death Therefore the permeabilization of mitochondria membranes provides a reasonable explanationfor mitochondrial DNA escape [ ] Other

apoptosisprocesses by upregulating proapoptosis protein BCL2associated X BAX and downregulating the BCL2 apoptosis[] On the other hand STINGsenescenceassociatedtheregulatoractivation in tumor cells not only facilitates the transcription of downstream type I IFNs to induce dendriticcell maturation but also recruits supportive immunecells for direct nonspontaneous tumor elimination []STING activation in nonmalignant cells causes tumorsuppressive effects as well STING signaling protectsagainst colitisassociated carcinomas CACs induced byazoxymethane AOM and dextran sulfate sodiumDSS which induce DNA damage in intestinal epithelialcells and further trigger STING activation Downstreamcytokines of STING signaling such as IL1 and IL18prevent neoplastic transformation by facilitating woundrepair More importantly STING signaling can also provoke cytotoxic T cell responses to control tumorigenesis[] Necrotic cancer cells are commonly engulfed byantigenpresenting cells especially the

Page  of tumordraining lymph node via the lymphatic systemwhere they crossprime tumorspecific CD8 T cellsThen CD8 T cells undergo activation and clonal expansion in the lymph nodes and are trafficked throughblood vessels to kill tumor cells In turn damaged cancercells release more antigens that are further captured byDCs the whole process forms a positive feedback loopcalled the cancerimmunity cycle [] Tumor eradication can be achieved by multiple processes in thecancerimmunity cycle including tumor antigen captureand presentation and T cell priming and activation withtumor antigenspecific T cell priming and activationrelying on DCs and type I IFN release [] The involvement of type I IFNs in innate immune sensing and adaptive immunity provides a reasonable hypothesis forexploring candidate PRR pathways as potential immunomodulators Mice lacking TLR9 myeloid differentiationprimary response gene  MyD88 cytosolic RNA sensor MAVS or the purinergic receptor P2X7R maintainintact antitumor immunity responses whereas mice deficient in STING or IRF3 present with impaired CD8 Tcell priming and activation [ ] In fact dying tumorcells can release multiple damageassociated molecularpatterns DAMPs to trigger innate immune responsesin DCs among these released stimuli tumor cellderivedDNA is a pivotal inducer In general the phagocytosis ofapoptotic cells causesimmune silence because ofDNasebased degradation [] Nevertheless tumor cellreleased DNA can be preserved in the DC endolysosomal compartment through an unknown mechanism [] cGAS recognizes DNA invading the cytoplasm andinduces the activation of STING cascades excretion oftype I IFNs and expression of ISGs Additionally undersome physiological conditions such as hypoxia andacidic environments nuclear or mitochondrial DNAmight be packaged in exosomes Exosomal DNAExoDNA animates STING signaling once it is absorbedby tumorinfiltrating DCs [] Finallytumor cellderived cGAMP can also be transferred to host DCs bythe folate transporter SLC19A1 and then directly bindsto STING activating it in DCs [] A recent study moredirectly demonstrated that cellautonomous STING promoted the maintenance of stem celllike CD8 T cellsand augmented antitumor T cell responses and mechanistically cGASSTINGmediated type I interferon signaling reinforced the stem cell\\u0093like CD8 T celldifferentiation program mainly by restraining Akt activity []Immune cellderived type I IFNs have crucial functions in antitumor immunity control On the one handtype I IFNs boost cross presentation by various mechanisms first they stimulate the maturation of DCs secondthey slow the endosomelysosome acidificationprocess to prevent engulfed tumor antigen clearance andelevate the expression of MHC I molecules on the cellsurface [  ] finally they accelerate DC migrationtowardslymph nodes where they can crossprimetumorspecific CD8 T cells [] On the other handtype I IFNs drive the expression of multiple chemokinessuch as CXCL9 and CXCL10 both of which are necessary for cytotoxic T lymphocyte CTL transfer and infiltration [] Similarly type I IFNs restrain the defaultimmune suppressive action of regulatory T Treg cellsby downregulating phosphodiesterase  PDE4 and upregulating cyclic AMP cAMP [] Consequently typeI IFNs serve as bridges linking the cGASSTING pathway with CD8 T cellmediated antitumor immunityThe antitumor mechanisms of the cGASSTING signaling axis are illustrated in Fig Indeed previous studies revealed that STING activation can stimulate antitumor immune responses inleukemia melanoma glioma and hepatocellular carcinoma [\\u0093] Additionally STING expression is downregulated in a wide variety of tumor tissues and celllines according to a pancancer analysis with a smallproportion of tumors approximately  bearing silent STING expression [] Lower STING expressionwas found in hepatic carcinoma and gastric cancer compared with its level in corresponding normal tissues andthis lower expression level was correlated with highertumor stage and poorer prognosis [ ] Consistentlycompared with that in the MCFG10A mammary epithelial cell line lower STING expression was detected inmalignant breast cancer cellincluding MCF7HBL100 and T47D cells as well as human melanomacell lines and colorectal adenocarcinoma lines [ ] Collectivelythat cGASSTING signaling might act as a tumor suppressor in certain types of cancersthese findings suggestlinesSTING pathway agonists as cancer therapeuticsThe immunostimulatory potential of the cGASSTINGpathway makes it an attractive pharmacological targetsince its activation in the tumor microenvironmentTME can induce efficient crosspriming oftumorspecific antigens and facilitate the infiltration of effectorT cells Recent drug research has focused on the development of STING agonists because of their potential inanticancer therapy [ ] To date various kinds ofSTING agonists have been discovered and they aremainly divided into the following categories cyclic dinucleotides and their derivates DMXAA and its analogsand small molecular agonists In addition some conventional antitumor therapeutics can also indirectly activateSTING such as chemotherapy radiotherapy RT andtargeted therapy [] In addition STING agonists areable to enhance the efficacy of other anticancer therapeutic agents when used in

heterogeneous in relation to the metastatic an examined. By Cox regression analysis center LVD and MVD periphery LVD and CAFs in distant metastasis were independently associated with patients' prognosis in addition to synchronous distant metastasis age and perineural invasion. Heterogeneity of microenvironment not only of cancer cells is suggested to contribute to tumor heterogeneity and biologic complexity thus it should be considered in managing CRC patients. In addition our results showed that PTEN expression was altered in CAFs of CRCs suggesting that CAFs might have altered gene expression and play an active role in cancer progression.

skin eyes heart lungs kidneys and other ans [ ] It affects   of the global population with a higher prevalence in females when compared with males [ ] Cardiovascular disease CVD is a common manifestation in RA patients with a two to threefold higher risk of cardiovascular events and mortality compared with a normal population [] However this increased risk is not entirely

conventional risk factors alone [\\u0093] are not suitable for RA patients and they either underestimate or overestimate the risk [\\u0093] This may be because of the paradoxical behavior of some of the conventional risk factors such as body mass index lowdensity lipoprotein highdensity lipoprotein and total cholesterol in RA [ ] Despite this lack of clarity the guidelines by the European League Against Rheumatism EULAR recommend aggressive control of these conventional risk factors [ ] Recent attempts were made to improve the CVD risk assessment in the RA population including the development of \\u009cRAspecific risk factors\\u009d in the CVD risk calculators [\\u0093] However such calculators could not provide adequate improvement in risk Vol01234567891 0c Rheumatology Internationalprediction and reportedly still underestimated or overestimated CVD risk in RA patients [ ]To provide a better CVD risk assessment in RA a pathophysiological association between these diseases should be understood as this would help in refining CVD risk predictors in RA patients [] Atherosclerosis a common phenomenon in RA [ ] can be adequately monitored using imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging [] computed tomography [] optical coherence tomography [] and ultrasound [] Each of these imaging modalities offers unique information about morphological variations in atherosclerotic plaque Ultrasound imaging specifically in carotid arteries is a comparatively lowcost noninvasive radiationfree and easytouse imaging modality that is widely adopted in preventive cardiovascular and clinical vascular practices [ ] The imagebased phenotypes of carotid ultrasound such as carotid intimamedia thickness cIMT and carotid plaque are considered surrogate markers of coronary artery disease and have been used for preventive CVD risk assessments in several studies [\\u0093] These imagebased phenotypes indicate the morphological variations in the atherosclerotic plaque and are associated with the inflammatory markers of RA [\\u0093] Patients with RA have elevated cIMT and have more plaque area PA when compared with nonRA patients [\\u0093] Thus the inclusion of these imagebased phenotypes in risk prediction models may improve the CVD risk assessments of RA patients Recent studies have combined the effect of these imagebased phenotypes with conventional risk factors including proinflammatory markers like erythrocyte sedimentation rate ESR to perform CVD risk assessment [\\u0093] Such integrated risk calculators have demonstrated better CVD risk stratification when compared to traditional CVD risk calculators in nonRA patients [  ]Besides these statistically derived CVD risk calculators artificial intelligence AIbased techniques are also penetrating  several  medical  imaging  and  risk  assessment applications [\\u0093] AIbased algorithms such as machine learning ML methods provide a better CVD risk assessment when compared with statistically derived conventional risk calculators [  ] So far AI algorithms have been used for CVD risk assessment in the nonRA population and their potential still needs to be evaluated in RA cohorts However AI is well adapted for RA screening and diagnosis [\\u0093] This review provides an insight into how the AIbased algorithms can be used for CVD risk assessment in RA patients There are three aims of this review  to summarize the pathophysiological pathways that link RA with CVD  to identify several traditional and carotid ultrasound imagebased CVD risk calculators for RA patients and  to provide an understanding of the role of artificial intelligence in CVD risk assessment in RA patientsSearch strategyFigure a0 shows a flow diagram indicating the search strategy for this

objectives of this review leading to  sPathophysiology of a0RA leading to a0CVDThe pathophysiological association between RA and CVD can be explained in two stages  the role of traditional risk factors and  direct vascular damage Inflammation plays a pivotal role in both of these stages []The role of a0traditional risk factors in a0the a0pathophysiology of a0RA\\u0091driven atherosclerotic CVDThe righthand panel of Fig a0 explains the pathophysiological association between RA and CVD via four pathways [Ia\\u0093Id] governed by traditional risk factors such as hypertension proatherogenic dyslipidemia insulin resistance and obesity Patients with RA are generally found with proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin IL  IL6 and tumor necrosis factor \\u00ce\\u00b1 TNF\\u00ce\\u00b1 [] These proinflammatory cytokines are found in the synovium which triggers a systemic inflammatory response and may result in damage to the vascular endothelial cells [] Nitric oxide NO and cyclooxygenase1 are two essential components required  0cRheumatology International Fig    Flow diagram for the search strategyto maintain the healthy endothelium which is inhibited by TNF\\u00ce\\u00b1 and IL6 thereby resulting in endothelial cell damage [ ] Inhibiting endothelial NO leads to arterial stiffness [] and is further associated with an increase in peripheral vascular resistance PVR [] thus leading to hypertension in RA patients Additionally several medications used to treat RA such as diseasemodifying antirheumatic drugs DMARDs leflunomide and cyclosporine glucocorticoids nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs NSAIDs and cyclooxygenase II inhibitors Cox IBs may also be involved in the development of hypertension in RA patients [ ]Another pathophysiological link between RA and CVD is proatherogenic dyslipidemia [] Nearly \\u0093 of RA patients have proatherogenic dyslipidemia [] In nonRA patients increased CVD risk is associated with elevated levels of lowdensity cholesterol LDLc total cholesterol and reduced highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol HDLc However in RA patients low levels of total cholesterol TC low levels of LDLc and suppressed levels of HDLc have been reported This condition is known as \\u009cthe lipid paradox\\u009d [] Highly suppressed HDL levels in RA patients are \\u009cproatherogenic\\u009d [] Furthermore RA patients show high atherogenic index levels despite low lipid levels The atherogenic index is calculated as a ratio of TC HDLc and it may vary according to their levels [] Apolipoprotein B Apo B is a major apolipoprotein in LDL and several studies have indicated an increase in the ratio of Apo B Apo A in RA patients [] A combination of low TC LDLc and suppressed HDLc levels with a high atherogenic index and a high ApoBApoA ratio behaves as proatherogenic dyslipidemia [  ]  Longstanding  proatherogenic  dyslipidemia causes atherosclerosis and eventually CVDRheumatoid cachexia is another important RAspecific characteristic that increases CVD risk [] It is characterized by significantly increased adiposity and reduced muscle mass while one maintains their bodyweight [] The pathophysiology [shown in \\u009cpathwayI c\\u009d] behind R cachexia can be explained in two ways  It is characterized by the reduction of muscle mass that is largely due to increased inflammatory cytokines particularly TNF\\u00ce\\u00b1 by activating the transcriptional nuclear factorkappa B cells NFkB pathway and promoting the ubiquitin pathway which causes catabolismproteolysis muscle protein breakdown [ ]  Central obesity or abdominal obesity is present in \\u0093 of women and \\u0093 of men This causes visceral adiposity in RA which has an additional adverse impact on CVD [] On the other hand increased adiposity also induces the production of inflammatory cytokines in RA which further worsens this  0c Rheumatology InternationalFig    Pathophysiological  association  between  rheumatoid  arthritis

strong association between insulin resistance IR metabolic syndrome and RA [ ] [shown in \\u009cpathwayI d\\u009d in the dark greendotted box] Inflammation plays a crucial role in these three conditions [] In patients with RA IR serves as an independent prognostic risk factor that signifies the presence of subclinical atherosclerosis it is determined by carotid intimal thickness cIMT and is measured by carotid ultrasonography [] Longstanding inflammation due to RA promotes oxidative stress endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis in this population []Progression of a0atherosclerosis and a0direct vessel damage in a0RAIn RA the activation of Tcells and mast cells increases the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL1 IL6 and TNF\\u00ce\\u00b1 These proinflammatory cytokines stimulate endothelial cells ECs and smooth muscle cells SMCs in subendothelium []  by expressing cell adhesion molecules such as vascular cell adhesion molecule  VCAM and the \\u009cintercellular adhesion molecule\\u009d ICAM [] and  by producing chemokines including monocyte chemoattractant protein MCP and macrophage colonystimulating factor MCSF The activation of endothelial cells allows the migration of LDLc into the subendothelial layer where  0cRheumatology International it becomes oxidized and triggers the inflammatory response for the recruitment of immune cells such as T lymphocytes and monocytes in the intimal layer Once they enter the intimal layer monocytes are transformed into macrophages and they then take up the oxidized LDLc to become foam cells The completion of this complex process then leads to the formation of atherosclerotic plaque Macrophages also trigger the migration of smooth muscle cells from tunica media to tunica intima and initiate their proliferation The SMCs form a thin fibrous cap to prevent the encroachment of atherosclerotic plaque towards the lumen However over time proinflammatory cytokines enzymes and free radicals cause fibrous cap erosion and make the plaque vulnerable for rupture The amplification of the inflammatory response results in the acceleration of plaque formation eventually leading to plaque rupture and thrombotic events which damage the blood vessels Pathway II of Fig a0 represents this processCurrent conventional CVD risk prediction models for a0RAOver the last decade several CVD risk assessment calculators have been developed very few of which are recommended by the cardiovascular risk management guidelines [  ] Some standard cardiovascular risk prediction algorithms are the Framingham risk score FRS [] Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation SCORE [] American College of CardiologyAmerican Heart Association ACCAHA risk score [] World Health anization WHO risk charts [] and Reynolds\\u0099s risk score RRS [] These risk calculators use traditional risk factors such as patient demographics age gender ethnicity blood biomarkers lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol and total cholesterol behavioral markers smoking and alcohol consumption and physiological markers height weight body mass index All these risk calculators were initially developed for nonRA populations therefore when used in RA cohorts CVD risk is substantially underestimated [\\u0093] The use of traditional risk factors alone while not considering RAspecific inflammatory markers could be another reason for such underestimation However RRS included an RAspecific inflammatory marker called \\u009chigh sensitivity Creactive protein\\u009d hsCRP [] for CVD risk prediction but did not report any significant improvement in the CVD risk assessment [] Rajagopalan et a0al [] also reported a small improvement in area under the curve   in females and   in males when C reactive protein CRP or erythrocyte sedimentation rate ESR was added to the FRSOver the past few years several efforts have been made to improve the cardiovascular risk assessment in RA patients The EULAR guidelines recommended the use of a modified SCORE mSCORE in RA patients positive with rheumatoid factor RF or anticitrullinated protein antibodies ACPA and RA duration of more than a0years [ ] Cox et a0al [ ] developed the QRISK2 and QRISK3 algorithms which use the presence of RA as a CVD risk predictor hazard ratio    confidence interval \\u0093 Solomon et a0al [] also developed an RAspecific CVD risk calculator called expanded risk score or ERS by including RAspecific biomarkers [such as disease activity disease duration a modified health assessment questionnaire HAQ disability index and daily prednisone use] with the traditional biomarkers used in the Coxbased model The authors reported an improvement of   in cindex when validating the risk score on the reserved dataset Recently Curtis et a0al [] also proposed a CVD risk prediction tool for RA patients by combining conventional and RAspecific risk factors The authors predicted the risk of composite CVD events such as MI stroke and death during the followup period of a0years The area under the curve AUC for cardiovascular risk stratification for this model was All these RAspecific CVD risk scores reported a better risk assessment on the proprietary databases Still when compared with other risk calculators in different RA cohorts these calculators have demonstrated mixed results [\\u0093] Crowson et a0al [] reported an underestimation of CVD risk by FRS and RRS in  RA patients The observed risk was twice the predicted risk Furthermore the authors did not report any improvement in cardiovascular risk prediction when CRP was added to their model Arts et a0al [] investigated the roles of SCORE FRS RRS and QRISK2 in  RA patients Out of these four models SCORE FRS and RRS underestimated CVD risk in RA patients whereas the QRISK2 reported an overestimation The AUC ranged between  and  for the four risk models A similar study by Arts et a0al [] investigated the performance of the original recalibrated and improved version of SCORE calculators to predict the CVD risk in  RA patients The AUC values for these scores were   CI \\u0093  \\u0093 and  \\u0093 All these three scores underestimated the CVD risk in RA patients In short even after the SCORE was redesigned using the RAbased risk factors it did not result in an adequate CVD risk assessment In another study by Crowson et a0al [] of  RA patients a CVDrisk prediction model was developed that reported better performance AUC   compared with conventional risk calculators such as FRS AUC   ACCAHA  AUC    SCORE  AUC    and QRISK2 AUC   Furthermore conventional risk calculators either overestimated or underestimated CVD risk in RA patients Wahlin et a0al [] compared the expanded risk score ACCAHA risk score and a modified version of ACCAHA with a multiplier of  for a CVD risk assessment of  0c Rheumatology International RA patients The authors also reported an underestimation of CVD risk by all calculators However the discrimination ability was slightly better since AUC for ERSRA risk was  compared to AUC of  for two variants of ACCAHAThe overall trend of all these risk prediction algorithms developed for general and RA cohorts indicates a \\u009cpoor CVD risk assessment\\u009d in patients with RA One possible reason for such poor performance is the paradoxical behavior of some of the risk factors such as lipids and body mass index Another potential reason for this outcome is the inclusion of risk factors that do not provide complete information about the CVD risk profile in RA patients [] Corrales et a0al [] indicated a high prevalence of carotid atherosclerosis plaque in patients with lowCVD risk This observation demonstrated the limited ability of conventional risk factorbased algorithms to improve the CVD risk assessment process which may be improved using imaging modalities Therefore there is still room to develop more accurate automated and reliable risk calculators for RA patients by exploring and including nontraditional risk factors such as genetic biomarkers inflammatory biomarkers or imagebased atherosclerotic plaque phenotypes in the risk prediction algorithmCarotid ultrasound atherosclerosis imaging for a0CVD risk assessment in a0RA patientsImaging modalities are becoming essential for the visualization of atherosclerotic plaque and CVD risk assessment in RA patients [] Noninvasive imaging modalities such as computed tomography magnetic resonance imaging ultrasound and positron emission tomography are currently used to assess carotid atherosclerosis in RA patients [] MRI is used to measure the plaque composition including calcification lipidrich necrotic core and fibrous cap thickness [] Computed tomography is generally used to determine carotid artery stenosis [] Ffludeoxyglucose\\u0093positron emission tomography FDGPET is a nuclear imaging modality that quantifies the inflammation in carotid atherosclerotic plaque [] Noninvasive carotid ultrasound is a commonly adopted imaging modality that can capture morphological variations in the atherosclerotic plaque quantified using  carotid intimamedia thickness cIMT  carotid intimamedia thickness variability IMTV and  plaque area [] When compared with other noninvasive counterparts carotid ultrasound is less expensive and easier to use [ ] Therefore the scope of this review is restricted to the use of carotid ultrasound for CVD risk assessment in RA patients The automated cIMT and carotid PA are considered surrogate markers of coronary artery disease and widely used for CVDstroke risk assessment [\\u0093]Several studies have shown a high prevalence of increased cIMT and carotid plaque in RA patients [\\u0093] Studies have also demonstrated the significant association between these carotid atherosclerosis biomarkers and RAspecific markers of inflammation such as ESR CRP and IL6 [\\u0093] Table a0 provides some of such studies that link both carotid atherosclerosis and RA using two sets of biomarkers ie imagebased phenotypes and inflammatory biomarkers One common observation from these studies is that patients with RA show an elevated cIMT and carotid plaque area compared with nonRA cohorts row R2\\u0093R4 of Table a0 [  ] This association between carotid atherosclerosis and RA also seems independent of the three carotid artery segments common carotid artery carotid bulb and internal carotid artery from where the cIMT or plaque was measured [ ] However several studies have reported more aggressive atherosclerotic plaque formation in the carotid bulb segment when compared to other arterial segments [] The higher plaque prevalence in the carotid bulb is a consequence of turbulent blood flow and reduced shear stress which leads to endothelial dysfunction [ ] This observation of higher plaque in a bulb has also been confirmed in RA patients [] Figure a0 shows carotid ultrasound scans for RA Fig a03a b and nonRA patients Fig a03c d The lefthand side panel of Fig a03a c shows the raw carotid ultrasound scans measured using a Bmode ultrasound scanner The broad usage of carotid ultrasoundbased phenotypes and their significant association with RAspecific Similarly the righthand side panels of Fig a03b d show the processed scans tracking morphological variations in the carotid atherosclerotic plaque for the quantification of cIMT and plaque area The cIMT and plaque area are both greater in RA patients than in nonRA patientsAnother important observation from Table a0 is the significant association between carotid atherosclerotic biomarkers and RAspecific inflammatory markers such as ESR CRP and IL6 [ ] ESR is a relatively inexpensive measure of inflammation in RA patients\\u0094therefore several studies have used ESR for CVD risk assessment [\\u0093] Some of such studies are listed in Table a0 All these studies indicated a substantially higher CVD event rate in patients with elevated ESR levels Besides ESR studies have also suggested the use of other popular RAspecific inflammatory markers such as CRP or hsCRP and IL6 for the improvement in the CVD risk assessment [   ] Furthermore these RAspecific inflammatory markers are also associated with the annual progression of cIMT [  \\u0093] which is a prominent surrogate marker of cardiovascular events In

prediction calculators [   ] Recently several CVDstroke risk prediction models have been developed that have combined the effect of conventional risk factors and the automated carotid atherosclerosis biomarkers [ ] These risk prediction models reported a better performance in identifying high CVD risk patients compared with current standardofcare risk calculators However such socalled integrated risk prediction models were developed for the general population They were based on the annual progression rates of carotid atherosclerotic biomarkers and conventional risk factors [\\u0093] Therefore given the progression rates of cIMT and PA due to the RAspecific inflammatory markers such models can be updated and might be useful for CVD risk assessment in RA patientsArtificial intelligence in a0CVDstroke risk assessmentArtificial  intelligence  AI  is  expeditiously  changing the landscape of the global healthcare system and assisting the healthcare workforce in clinical decisionmaking [] Machine learning ML and deep learning DL are the two common branches of AI that have broad ranges of applications in almost every medical imaging sector eg classification and plaque characterization for stroke risk assessment [] thyroid cancer characterization [] liver cancer diagnosis [] prostate cancer diagnosis ovarian cancer diagnosis [] lung cancer detection [] brain tumor classification [] and heart disease prediction and disease classification [  ] During the recent global pandemic of coronavirus diseases  AI is providing promising results in the diagnosis of patients with the help of several imaging techniques such as computed tomography [] and Xrays []Since this review is on CVDstroke risk assessment we have summarized several studies that have used MLbased algorithms for CVDstroke risk assessment Table a0 All of these studies follow a supervised learning approach in which the MLbased classifier is trained to identify the correct output labels using input risk factors or features and predefined gold standards or labels Figure a0 shows the generalized framework of supervised MLbased CVD risk assessment In the case of CVD risk assessment the gold standard can be  the primary endpoints such as presence or absence of cardiovascular events or  surrogate endpoints such as cIMT PA and CAC score or a combination of these risk factors [  ] Several types of input features can be used to train the AIbased algorithms They can be traditional risk factors imagebased phenotypes grayscale image features or statistically derived features Once the offline ML classifier is trained using these features and gold DAC rof RO roF gnikomS MD NTH PBD PBS IMB egAaimedipilrepyH thgiehPCdna TM Ic \\u00b1 ][  nosetnavSR 0cRheumatology International Fig    Carotid ultrasound image of the common carotid artery for control patientsstandard its coefficients are then used in the online ML system to predict the out risk labels Online ML systems do not require a gold standard to make the final risk classification All the studies provided in Table a0 used this approach for CVD risk assessment Unlike MLbased algorithms DLbased models such as convolutional neural networks do not require input features beforehand Instead such algorithms automatically learn their offline coefficients from the input image datasets [] Currently AIbased techniques are used in the diagnosis of RA [] the identification of RA disease severity [] the classification of several RA synovial tissues [] and mortality prediction due to RA [] Although MLbased algorithms are used in the RA field no efforts have been made to assess the CVD risk in RA patients using such automated intelligencebased paradigms MLbased algorithms have been used to perform CVD risk assessments in nonRA populations and reported a better performance in identifying highrisk CVD patients when compared with the current standard of care conventional risk calculators [  ] Patients with RA experience more atherosclerotic plaque in the carotid artery which might lead to cardiovascular events [\\u0093] In recent years several studies have demonstrated a better stroke risk assessment using MLbased strategies [] and DLbased strategies [] Besides all these studies attempts can be made to develop more accurate CVD risk prediction tools for RA patients using AI techniques Figure a0 conceptualizes several components required for CVD risk assessment in RA patients The AIbased CVD risk assessment for RA patients can be made possible by combining several types of risk factors such as patients\\u0099 demographics physiological parameters behavioral risk factors imagebased phenotypes and most importantly RAspecific inflammatory markers This combined set of features can be used as inputs along with the gold standard to identify what CVD risk category RA patients belong to As such both ML and DLbased systems can be employed to performed CVD risk assessment in patients Because of the significant association between carotid atherosclerosis and RA researchers can conduct a pilot study with cIMT and plaque areas as the surrogate markers for CVD risk assessmentSummaryIn this review we provided

\\u0082ammationassociated signalling [ ] It is a threestep enzymatic process that consists of ubiquitinactivatingenzyme E1 ubiquitinconjugating enzyme E2 and ubiquitin ligase E3 [] E3 ligases transfer activated ubiquitin fromE2 to speci\\u00ef\\u00ac\\u0081c substrates thereby forming mono or polyubiquitinated proteins to activate proteasomemediated proteolysis signal transduction endocytosis etc [] E3 ligases arecrucial as they catalyse target ubiquitination and enable theformation of polyubiquitin chains that enhance the complexity of ubiquitination in physiological and pathological processes Although dysregulated ubiquitination is involved inthe development of various types of immune pathologieseg systemic lupus erythematosus rheumatoid arthritisand \\u0082ammatory bowel disease [IBD] [ ] there is limitedknowledge regarding the role of RINGtype ligases in\\u0082ammationassociated pathways In this review we havefocused on IBD owing to its complex pathogenesis involvement in a wide range of etiological factors including dysregulated ubiquitination The term IBD is used for a group ofchronic autoimmune gastrointestinal disordersincludingmainly Crohn\\u0099s disease CD and ulcerative colitis UC []Chronicity of IBD often causes intestinal complications hospitalisation steroid dependency and surgery in diagnosedpatients [] Although significant progress has been made inunderstanding the nature of IBD the underlying interactingmechanism involving ubiquitination RINGtype ligases andonset of IBD remains to be fully understood Ubiquitination Mediated by RINGType LigasesHuman cells express more than  E3 ubiquitin ligases thatare classi\\u00ef\\u00ac\\u0081ed into three types based on their catalyticdomains RING HECT homologous to the E6AP carboxylterminus and

polyubiquitin chains with varying linkage speci\\u00ef\\u00ac\\u0081cities such as that on Lys48 during the proteasomal targeting ofsubstrates and Lys63 in signal transduction thereby modulating
